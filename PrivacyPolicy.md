# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 18, 2026**

This browser extension ("the Extension") is designed with a very simple privacy philosophy:

**We collect, store, process, share or transmit absolutely no personal data from you.**

## Key Facts in Plain Language

## What data is actually handled?

### Scenario A – Completely offline extension
Nothing leaves your computer. Period.  
→ No privacy policy would even be needed, but we still provide this document for transparency.

### Scenario B – Extension needs to read current page content or specific tab information  
(Example: content script that reads/modifies the current webpage)

In this case the Extension may **temporarily**:

- see the content of the web page you are currently visiting  
- see the URL of the tab that is currently active  

**This information:**

- never leaves your device  
- is not logged  
- is not stored persistently  
- is not sent anywhere  
- is discarded as soon as the current execution context ends (usually milliseconds to seconds)
